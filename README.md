# ‚ùì About

Fetcharoni is a simple app that allows you to test out an API or make http requests. It uses the Node.js fetch API. Fetcharoni is a simple and lightweight version of something like Insomnia or Postman. It is not entirely an alternative as it does not have a lot of the features that other similar apps like Insomnia or Postman offer. I made this project to learn more about Electron. You can [donate](https://www.patreon.com/axorax) if you like the project or want to support me! <3

To download, go to the releases page. The file `fetcharoni.exe` is the sinlge executable file. You can also find setup files in various formats.
