# ‚ùì About

axoget is a simple app that allows you to test out an API or make http requests. It uses the Node.js fetch API. axoget is a simple and lightweight version of something like Insomnia or Postman. It is not entirely an alternative as it does not have a lot of the features that other similar apps like Insomnia or Postman offer.

Remember, you are writing JavaScript so in the address input if you put `${1 + 1}` it will be 2.

I made this project to learn more about Electron and TypeScript. You can [donate](https://www.patreon.com/axorax) if you like the project or want to support me! <3

To download, go to the releases page. The file `axoget.exe` is the sinlge executable file. You can also find setup files in various formats.

> [!NOTE]  
> When running the app for the first time (with the source code not the executable), it may restart a few times as it needs to compile TypeScript, SCSS and Pug. Also you may get an error popup at the start, ignore it and wait. None of this happens in the production executable app.

# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FAQ

## Difference between preview and render?

Preview loads the HTML directly. Render loads the HTMl with absolute paths for script and style tags. So, if some HTML does not work in preview (CSS doesn't appear) then it might work in render.
